# Specification Quality Checklist: Internal Knowledge Base Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Validation Details

1. **Content Quality**: The specification is written entirely from a user/business perspective without mentioning specific technologies (Vercel, Supabase, Sanity were mentioned in the user input but not in the requirements themselves). All mandatory sections are complete with detailed content.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 25 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are present - the spec makes reasonable assumptions (documented in the Assumptions section) for unspecified details. Success criteria are all measurable with specific metrics (time, percentages, counts).

3. **Feature Readiness**: The spec includes 6 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) with clear acceptance scenarios following Given-When-Then format. The feature scope is well-defined with 8 edge cases identified. Dependencies and assumptions are clearly documented.

4. **Technology Agnostic**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes (e.g., "find documentation in under 30 seconds", "90% successful authentication") rather than technical metrics like API response times or database performance.

## Notes

- The specification successfully captures the essence of a Tettra clone while remaining implementation-agnostic
- The @inbound.no email domain restriction is clearly defined as a security requirement
- Import functionality is appropriately prioritized as P4 (nice to have) per user guidance
- Design system styling requirements are noted but don't prescribe specific implementation approaches
- All user stories are independently testable with clear value propositions
