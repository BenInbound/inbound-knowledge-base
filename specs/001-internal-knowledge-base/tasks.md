## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - BLOCKS all other stories (authentication required)
- **User Story 1 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US2 completion (need auth to view content)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 + US2 completion (need to view and be authenticated to create)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 + US2 + US3 completion (need content creation before organization)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 + US2 completion (independent feature, only needs viewing and auth)
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on US3 + US4 completion (needs creation and organization logic)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### Critical Path (MVP)

The absolute minimum path to a functional MVP:

1. **Phase 1** (Setup) ‚Üí **Phase 2** (Foundational) ‚Üí **Phase 3** (US2 - Authentication) ‚Üí **Phase 4** (US1 - View/Search)

This gives you a working knowledge base where authenticated users can browse and search content.

### User Story Dependencies

```
US2 (Auth)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ US1 (View/Search) [Can deliver MVP here!]
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ US3 (Create/Edit)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ US4 (Categories)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ US6 (Import)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ US5 (Q&A) [Independent branch]
```

- **US2 (P1)**: BLOCKS everything - must complete first
- **US1 (P1)**: Depends on US2 - delivers MVP viewing capability
- **US3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 + US2 - enables content creation
- **US4 (P2)**: Depends on US1 + US2 + US3 - organizes content
- **US5 (P3)**: Depends on US1 + US2 - independent Q&A feature
- **US6 (P4)**: Depends on US3 + US4 - migration feature

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Setup (Phase 1)**: Tasks T002-T012 can all run in parallel (different config files)

**Within Foundational (Phase 2)**:
- Database tables (T014-T020) can be defined in parallel
- UI components (T033-T038) can be built in parallel
- Utilities (T039-T042) can be created in parallel

**After Foundational Phase**:
- **If working solo**: Complete US2 ‚Üí US1 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5 ‚Üí US6 (sequential by priority)
- **If team of 2**: After US2 completes, Developer A tackles US1 while Developer B works on US3
- **If team of 3+**: After US2 completes, split work on US1, US3, and US5 simultaneously

**Within Each User Story**: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

## Implementation Strategy

### Strategy 1: MVP First (Recommended for Solo Developer)

**Goal**: Get to a working product ASAP

1. ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Setup (essential infrastructure)
2. ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Foundational (BLOCKS everything - critical to complete)
3. ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: US2 - Authentication (security gate)
4. ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: US1 - View & Search (MVP is ready!)
5. üéâ **STOP and VALIDATE**: Deploy MVP, gather feedback
6. Then add US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5 ‚Üí US6 based on feedback

**MVP Delivers**: Authenticated team members can browse, search, and view all existing documentation. Import initial content manually or via seed script.

### Strategy 2: Incremental Delivery (Recommended for Team)

**Goal**: Deliver value continuously

1. ‚úÖ Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation Ready
2. ‚úÖ US2 (Auth) ‚Üí Security Gate Working
3. ‚úÖ US1 (View/Search) ‚Üí **DEPLOY MVP #1** üöÄ (read-only knowledge base)
4. ‚úÖ US3 (Create/Edit) ‚Üí **DEPLOY MVP #2** üöÄ (living documentation)
5. ‚úÖ US4 (Categories) ‚Üí **DEPLOY MVP #3** üöÄ (organized content)
6. ‚úÖ US5 (Q&A) ‚Üí **DEPLOY MVP #4** üöÄ (community knowledge)
7. ‚úÖ US6 (Import) ‚Üí **DEPLOY Final** üöÄ (full migration complete)

Each deployment adds value without breaking previous features.

### Strategy 3: Parallel Team (Recommended for Team of 3+)

**Goal**: Maximize team velocity

1. **Together**: Complete Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational)
2. **Together**: Complete Phase 3 (US2 - Authentication) - critical gate
3. **Split Work After US2**:
   - Developer A: US1 (View/Search) - P1
   - Developer B: US3 (Create/Edit) - P2
   - Developer C: US5 (Q&A) - P3
4. US1 completes first ‚Üí Deploy MVP #1
5. US3 completes ‚Üí Integrate with US1 ‚Üí Deploy MVP #2
6. **Developer A** (freed up): Start US4 (Categories)
7. US5 completes ‚Üí Integrate ‚Üí Deploy MVP #3
8. US4 completes ‚Üí Deploy MVP #4
9. **Developer B** (freed up): Start US6 (Import)
10. US6 completes ‚Üí Deploy Final

**Note**: US4 depends on US3, and US6 depends on US3+US4, so timing matters.

## Notes

- ‚úÖ All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- ‚úÖ Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation and testing
- ‚úÖ Each user story has clear goal, test criteria, and completion checkpoint
- ‚úÖ Dependencies are explicit and prevent blocking work
- ‚úÖ MVP path is clearly identified (Setup + Foundational + US2 + US1)
- ‚úÖ Parallel opportunities maximize team efficiency
- ‚úÖ Tests are OPTIONAL and not included (not explicitly requested in spec)
- üìù Commit after completing each task or logical group
- üõë Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- üöÄ Deploy early and often - each user story adds value
