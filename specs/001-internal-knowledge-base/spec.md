# Feature Specification: Internal Knowledge Base Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-internal-knowledge-base`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Can you see what the app tettra is? It's for making a kind of knowlege base of documentation for internal companies. I only want people with an @inbound.no email address to be able to access the documents - I don't want anyone on the internet to be able to login. I would like to use varcel and supabase. Could use sanity for this. I basically want you to make a clone of Tettra. I also have some of our data that was exportred from out Tettra account- it would be nice if we could import it but really too neccessary if it comlicates things. I also have connected figma mcp server so you can see our stlyes here: https://www.figma.com/design/rg8BkfzZU04Dvk7ejm6fZC/Inbound-website-2025?node-id=2060-611&m=dev . I have also added our fonts to the folder: TT Hoves Pro - feel free to use what you must and move the files."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View and Search Knowledge Base (Priority: P1)

Inbound.no team members need to quickly find company information and documentation in a centralized location. They should be able to browse categories, search for specific topics, and view detailed articles without needing to know where information is stored.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that delivers immediate value. Without search and viewing capabilities, the knowledge base cannot serve its primary purpose. This is the foundation upon which all other features depend.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in with an @inbound.no email, browsing at least 3 categories of documentation, performing searches for specific topics, and successfully viewing article content. Delivers immediate value by making existing documentation accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a team member is authenticated with @inbound.no email, **When** they access the knowledge base home page, **Then** they see a list of available categories and a prominent search bar
2. **Given** a team member views a category, **When** they click on it, **Then** they see all articles within that category organized by relevance or last updated date
3. **Given** a team member enters a search term in the search bar, **When** they submit the search, **Then** they see relevant articles ranked by relevance with highlighted matching text snippets
4. **Given** a team member clicks on an article, **When** the article loads, **Then** they see the full content with proper formatting, images, and links
5. **Given** a team member is viewing an article, **When** they want to return to browsing, **Then** they can navigate back to categories or perform a new search

---

### User Story 2 - Restricted Access by Email Domain (Priority: P1)

The knowledge base must only be accessible to team members with @inbound.no email addresses. Any attempt to access by users with other email domains should be prevented at the authentication level.

**Why this priority**: Critical security requirement. This ensures confidential company information remains private and is only accessible by authorized team members. Must be implemented from day one.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by attempting to sign up/login with both @inbound.no emails (should succeed) and non-@inbound.no emails (should be rejected with clear messaging). Delivers security and privacy value immediately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user attempts to sign up, **When** they enter an email address not ending in @inbound.no, **Then** they receive an error message stating "Access is restricted to @inbound.no email addresses only"
2. **Given** a user attempts to login, **When** they use an email address not ending in @inbound.no, **Then** the authentication fails with a message indicating access is restricted
3. **Given** a team member with @inbound.no email signs up, **When** they complete the authentication process, **Then** they gain full access to the knowledge base
4. **Given** an authenticated session exists, **When** the user's email domain is verified, **Then** the system maintains their access throughout the session
5. **Given** no authentication exists, **When** a user tries to access any knowledge base content directly via URL, **Then** they are redirected to the login page

---

### User Story 3 - Create and Edit Documentation (Priority: P2)

Team members need the ability to create new articles, edit existing content, and organize documentation into categories. This enables the knowledge base to grow and stay current with company information.

**Why this priority**: Essential for knowledge base maintenance and growth, but viewing content (P1) must work first. This turns the platform from read-only to a living documentation system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in, creating a new article with formatting and images, editing an existing article, and organizing content into categories. Delivers value by allowing the team to build and maintain documentation without technical barriers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated team member views the knowledge base, **When** they click "Create New Article", **Then** they see a rich text editor interface
2. **Given** a team member is creating an article, **When** they add text formatting, images, and links, **Then** the editor preserves all formatting and media
3. **Given** a team member finishes writing an article, **When** they click "Publish", **Then** the article becomes immediately visible to all other team members
4. **Given** a team member views an article they or others created, **When** they click "Edit", **Then** they can modify the content with the same editor capabilities
5. **Given** a team member creates or edits an article, **When** they assign it to a category, **Then** the article appears in that category's listing
6. **Given** a team member is editing, **When** they choose to save as draft, **Then** the content is saved but not visible to others until published

---

### User Story 4 - Category and Content Organization (Priority: P2)

Team members need to organize knowledge base content into logical categories and subcategories that reflect how the company structures information. Categories should be easily manageable and clearly display the hierarchy of information.

**Why this priority**: Critical for scalability and usability as content grows, but basic viewing (P1) and creation (P2) must work first. Good organization prevents the knowledge base from becoming chaotic.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple categories, adding subcategories, moving articles between categories, and verifying the navigation structure reflects the organization. Delivers value by making information architecture clear and maintainable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a team member has appropriate permissions, **When** they create a new category, **Then** it appears in the main navigation structure
2. **Given** a category exists, **When** a team member creates a subcategory within it, **Then** the hierarchy is visually represented in navigation
3. **Given** an article exists in a category, **When** a team member moves it to a different category, **Then** it appears in the new location and is removed from the old one
4. **Given** multiple categories exist, **When** a team member reorders them, **Then** the navigation reflects the new order
5. **Given** a team member views the knowledge base, **When** they see the category structure, **Then** it clearly shows parent-child relationships

---

### User Story 5 - Q&A System for Unanswered Questions (Priority: P3)

When team members cannot find answers in existing documentation, they need a way to ask questions that can be routed to subject matter experts. Once answered, these Q&As should be searchable by other team members.

**Why this priority**: Valuable for knowledge gap identification and community learning, but core documentation features (P1, P2) must be solid first. This prevents repeated questions and helps identify missing documentation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting a new question, having an expert answer it, and verifying that both the question and answer are searchable. Delivers value by creating a feedback loop that improves documentation coverage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a team member cannot find information, **When** they click "Ask a Question", **Then** they can submit a question with title and description
2. **Given** a question is submitted, **When** the system processes it, **Then** it appears in a questions list visible to all team members
3. **Given** a team member with knowledge sees an unanswered question, **When** they provide an answer, **Then** the answer is attached to the question and marked as answered
4. **Given** a question has been answered, **When** other team members search for related terms, **Then** the Q&A pair appears in search results
5. **Given** multiple questions exist, **When** a team member views the Q&A section, **Then** they can filter by answered/unanswered status

---

### User Story 6 - Import Existing Tettra Data (Priority: P4)

The team has exported data from their existing Tettra account and would like to import it into the new knowledge base to avoid starting from scratch. This should preserve article content, categories, and basic metadata.

**Why this priority**: Nice to have for migration convenience, but not essential for the platform to function. Lower priority because the team indicated it's not necessary if it complicates things, and the system must work well with manually entered content first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by preparing a sample export file, running the import process, and verifying that articles, categories, and content are correctly migrated. Delivers value by reducing manual data entry during migration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator has a Tettra export file, **When** they upload it through an import interface, **Then** the system validates the file format
2. **Given** a valid export file is uploaded, **When** the import process runs, **Then** all articles are created with their original content
3. **Given** the import completes, **When** team members browse categories, **Then** the category structure from Tettra is preserved
4. **Given** imported content exists, **When** team members search or browse, **Then** imported articles behave identically to manually created ones
5. **Given** an import error occurs, **When** the process fails, **Then** the administrator receives clear error messages indicating what went wrong

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a team member's email domain changes or they leave the company?
- How does the system handle concurrent editing of the same article by multiple users?
- What happens if a team member tries to delete a category that contains articles?
- How does the system handle very large articles (10,000+ words) or large image uploads?
- What happens when search returns no results or too many results (100+)?
- How does the system handle broken links within articles or references to deleted content?
- What happens if authentication service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle special characters or non-English text in article content?
