# Security Review - Inbound Knowledge Base
**Review Date:** October 20, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ READY FOR PRODUCTION

## Summary
Your application has been reviewed for common security vulnerabilities and follows security best practices. A few minor issues were identified and have been fixed.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Secure

### 1. Environment Variables & Secrets
- ‚úÖ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` - sensitive keys won't be committed
- ‚úÖ `.env.local.example` contains only placeholder values
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded API keys or secrets found in source code
- ‚úÖ All Supabase credentials use `process.env` variables
- ‚úÖ Service role keys are never used client-side

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- ‚úÖ All protected routes require authentication via middleware
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all database tables
- ‚úÖ Admin routes properly check for admin role before allowing access
- ‚úÖ Users cannot change their own role (prevented in API)
- ‚úÖ Authors can only edit/delete their own articles (unless admin)
- ‚úÖ Draft articles only visible to author or admin

### 3. Input Validation
- ‚úÖ Zod schemas validate all user input (articles, categories, etc.)
- ‚úÖ File upload validation:
  - Maximum file size: 5MB
  - Allowed types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, image/webp
  - File type checking on both client and server
- ‚úÖ Image compression before upload (max 1920px, 85% quality)

### 4. Database Security
- ‚úÖ All queries use Supabase client (prevents SQL injection)
- ‚úÖ RLS policies properly use `USING` and `WITH CHECK` clauses
- ‚úÖ Storage bucket policies restrict users to their own folders
- ‚úÖ No raw SQL queries with user input

### 5. XSS Protection
- ‚úÖ No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- ‚úÖ React automatically escapes JSX content
- ‚úÖ TipTap editor sanitizes HTML content
- ‚úÖ CSP headers configured in `next.config.js`

### 6. Security Headers
‚úÖ Comprehensive security headers configured:
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` (clickjacking protection)
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-XSS-Protection`
- `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP)
- `Permissions-Policy` (disables camera, microphone, etc.)

### 7. Storage Security
- ‚úÖ Users can only upload to their own folder (userId-based paths)
- ‚úÖ Users can only delete their own images
- ‚úÖ Public read access only (images are viewable but not modifiable)
- ‚úÖ File size limits enforced at database level (5MB)
- ‚úÖ MIME type restrictions enforced

### 8. API Security
- ‚úÖ All API routes check authentication
- ‚úÖ Permission checks before data modification
- ‚úÖ Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- ‚úÖ No direct database access from client side

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. Debug Logging Removed
**Issue:** Debug `console.log()` statements in production could leak data
**Fixed:** Removed all debug logging from `/app/(protected)/categories/[id]/page.tsx`
**Kept:** `console.error()` statements for error monitoring (safe for production)

### 2. RLS Policies Corrected
**Issue:** Missing `WITH CHECK` clauses in RLS policies
**Fixed:** Updated policies in migrations:
- `20251020000003_fix_update_policies.sql`
- `20251020000004_fix_article_categories_policy.sql`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Recommendations

### 1. CSP Relaxation for TipTap
**Note:** Content Security Policy allows `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline` for scripts
**Reason:** Required by TipTap rich text editor
**Risk:** Low - TipTap is a trusted library with XSS protections built-in
**Recommendation:** Accept this tradeoff, it's necessary for the editor to function

### 2. Public Image Bucket
**Note:** Uploaded images are publicly accessible
**Risk:** Low - this is intentional for a knowledge base
**Mitigation:** Users can only upload to their own folders and cannot delete others' images

### 3. Service Role Key (Scripts)
**Note:** `scripts/publish-all-drafts.js` can use service role key
**Risk:** Low - script is not deployed, only run locally by administrators
**Recommendation:** Keep this script out of the repository if it contains sensitive operations, or ensure service role key is never committed

### 4. Rate Limiting
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Not implemented
**Risk:** Medium - could allow brute force attacks or DoS
**Recommendation:** Consider adding rate limiting via:
- Vercel's built-in rate limiting (Enterprise plan)
- Upstash Rate Limit (free tier available)
- Supabase Auth built-in rate limiting (already active for auth endpoints)

### 5. Error Logging
**Status:** ‚úÖ Using `console.error` for server-side errors
**Recommendation:** Consider adding structured error logging:
- Sentry for error tracking
- Vercel Analytics for monitoring
- Log only error messages, never full error objects with stack traces in production

## üöÄ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [x] `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in source code
- [x] Debug logging removed
- [x] RLS policies updated and tested
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] File upload validation in place
- [ ] Verify Vercel environment variables are set:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- [ ] Test authentication on production URL
- [ ] Verify Supabase project URL matches in both .env and supabase/config.toml
- [ ] Test RLS policies on production database
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is active (automatic on Vercel)

## üìã Security Best Practices for Ongoing Development

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Keep dependencies updated** - Run `npm audit` regularly
3. **Review RLS policies** - When adding new tables
4. **Validate all input** - Use Zod schemas for new endpoints
5. **Test authentication** - Before deploying permission changes
6. **Monitor errors** - Check Vercel logs for suspicious activity
7. **Backup database** - Supabase has daily backups, but export important data periodically

## üîí Security Contact

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue
2. Contact the development team directly
3. Provide details about the vulnerability and steps to reproduce
